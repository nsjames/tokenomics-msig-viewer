# Tokenomics MSIG Viewer

This is a web app that shows you the MSIG for the EOS tokenomics changes. It's needed because all msig UIs don't handle 
unpacking MSIGs properly when new actions are called on a newly set contract within the same MSIG. 

You can see it live at https://msigviewer.netlify.app/
